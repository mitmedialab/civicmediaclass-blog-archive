					<description><![CDATA[Interesting idea, this appeals to me on the level where I&#039;ve wondered how and why people appear to vote against their self interest in elections. I would imagine that the language used to frame issues would be hugely contested (is a raise in the minimum wage more money in the person&#039;s pocket or will it eliminate their job, as some claim?). And it seems like it would have to steer away from moral issues that have been politicized, but maybe that&#039;s a feature, not a bug!]]></description>
