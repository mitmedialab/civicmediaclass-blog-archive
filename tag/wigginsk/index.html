			<p>For this week&#8217;s assignment, I thought it would be best to look at some of the initiatives taken by various government websites to employ Benkler&#8217;s Gov 2.0. I came across a website that I had heard of before but never actually took the time to look at- <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.ny.gov/</span>. At first glance, <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.ny.gov/</span> looked like exactly what Benkler called for.</p>
<p>When you first enter the site, you see various issues and are allowed to show your support for them. Under the issue, there is a tab called &#8220;Get Involved&#8221; that surprisingly lets you get involved. Similar to petitions, this form asks you to sign in and then show your support for the program so that your electronic signature can be accounted for. Unlike other petition websites that I have seen, you can also provide your own story regarding the issue. You can state how the issue impacted you and state your own opinion regarding the issue rather than just being cast into a simple for or against position. The site also offers data and statistics to back up the stance of the petition. Even though this data does not really allow the government to get a better idea of the needs of the citizens, this seemed to be exactly what Benkler wanted. People would be participating directly within government by offering their opinions on major issues.</p>
<p>This site even went past the simple petitioning site. It offered methods to complete certain tasks that involved the government such as filling out tax returns or starting your own business. It also had a section that tells users about events in New York State where the issues brought up on the website would be discussed. When you add the use of apps by <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.ny.gov/</span> to further inform the public about everyday issues such as crime and transportation, <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.ny.gov/</span> appears to be Gov 2.0 in action. The main problem I found with this website was what Benkler first proposed for the new Gov 2.0-openness.</p>
<p>Benkler repeatedly mentioned that these Gov 2.0 sites should be open to spark growth and innovation. Users would be able to input their ideas and the government could learn from the citizens. The site <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.ny.gov/</span> does not allow this to happen. From what I saw, all the issues that were brought up and discussed were brought up by the makers of the website. The users of the site could not propose to discuss about a issue that was troubling them. All the issues that were discussed were the issues the government wanted for the citizens of New York State to discuss. Albeit these issues are relevant and significant, it seems to go directly against Benkler&#8217;s ideal Gov 2.0. Benkler wanted for the citizens and the government to work with one another in an open, unrestricted space so that effective change would come about. The website looks like it is only willing to do this for issues it feels are appropriate for this new type of discussion. This made me wonder just how ready is the government for Gov 2.0? Gov 2.0 would take away some of the power of the government and place it in the hands of the citizens. But aren&#8217;t we in a democracy so all the power already lies in the hand of the people? Or are we in an oligarchy and Gov 2.0 would represent a revolution towards a true democracy?</p>

			<p>Ever since I could remember, my family has frowned upon online shopping. I didn&#8217;t understand why my family hated it and whenever I asked why, I was always given the &#8220;you&#8217;re a child and I&#8217;m an adult so listen to whatever I say&#8221; look. When I finally began making my own money and decided how I wanted to spend it, I began laughing at my family. I was able to order everything I wanted without me even having to walk or take the bus downtown to get it. Online shopping made life seem so much more easier. Next thing I knew, something that would completely alter my life occurred.</p>
<p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQdVtNkqGA7cB-Ox6-ufdekEXLQBx8kgVK7YjcWQUR41qoB7zAJ" alt="Image result for ebay" /></p>
<p>When Ebay and I first crossed paths, it seemed like a beneficial relationship for both sides. I would be buying a product I wanted and the idea I had of Ebay being a perfect site would be upheld. During the first few encounters, everything was great. I managed to buy a book, a basketball, a hooded sweatshirt and some shoes. I was working my way up to the big buy, a new phone that I desperately needed. I had saved up my money for two months and had finally earned enough to get the phone I desired. I ordered a phone that I thought would be slightly used. When the order came in I found out that phone was used a lot more than what I thought it was. In fact, the previous owner was probably still using it because I got duped. All I received was a cell phone box full of Styrofoam. When I came to my mom for help, all she could do was laugh at me. I realized then what I was ignorant to before, the Ebay Hustle.</p>
<p>Sites like Ebay are successful due to their ability to connect someone who needs a certain good with someone who is trying to sell it. The bidding war occurs for the product and the transaction is made with limited government interference. At times, this lack of interference is a good thing for both the buyer and the seller because it makes the process a whole lot easier. In instances like mine, however, this interference is needed. I was hustled out of my phone and all I could do was sit around and file a complaint with Ebay. That complaint got me nowhere. Ebay threatened the guy and maybe even deleted his account but I was still left without a phone.</p>
<p>Ebay, Craigslist and other sites that take out the middle man in transactions are extremely useful but are just too risky for me. They are extremely open and people can take advantage of the website with relative ease. Small and insignificant punishments are handed out to people who do this, leaving people like me helpless. I just can&#8217;t take a chance on that happening to me ever again. The middle man, no matter how much I hate to say it, is needed. All of its meddling and interference is needed to ensure fairness. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m saying this but my family was right.</p>

			<p>When I began thinking about citizen journalism, all I could envision was the most honorable examples. Examples that included people dedicating themselves to improving society through altruistic acts. When thinking about it some more, I began to realize that citizen journalism doesn’t necessarily have to be performed by the most unselfish people; citizen journalism is literally journalism performed by citizens. It is when average, ordinary citizens with their own flaws and problems decide to spread a message to the public, despite whether they had good intentions while doing it. For me, the most compelling form of citizen journalism is comics and cartoons. These methods are the most effective due to their simplicity as well as their effect.</p>
<p>As an adolescent, I couldn’t help but pick up my mother’s newspaper and go straight towards the comics. At that age, it probably would have been better for me to actually read an article but I think that the comics still served a great purpose. They informed me about some of the issues going on in the world and actually portrayed them in a facetious manner so that it could keep my attention. These comics also helped fortify some of the values that I was already learning from growing up.</p>
<p>Today, as an adult, my outlook on comics and cartoons may have changed but their impact on the youth is still evident. Comics can bridge a gap that is caused by age. Through visuals and comedic relief, comics help teach younger people as well as less educated people whereas long, sophisticated articles would only confuse them. The simplicity of comics allow them to be understood by a greater audience.</p>
<p>Comics and cartoons have also been sparks for social change throughout history. For example, cartoons such as this have revealed issues to the public by using fewer words.</p>
<p><img class=" alignright" src="http://www.addictinginfo.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NastBlaineLanguagecrop.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="272" /></p>
<p>In today’s society, comics could even be better utilized. According to “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/education/05civics.html">Failing Grades on Civics Exam Called a ‘Crisis</a>‘”, the American youth doesn’t know about some of the most basic government processes. This could be caused by a lack of time to pay attention to government or by just never being adequately informed about the government. Either way, comics can help solve the issue. It takes minutes, sometimes even seconds, to understand comics and most of them are not boring enough to cause one to stop halfway while reading it. Comics also will help inspire others to participate in citizen journalism in their own way. In Putnam’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/p/putnam-alone.html"><em>Bowling Alone</em></a> “, participation by the American people in community organizations is on the decline after being so high during the 1960s. Through the use of comics, the American people could learn information in a quick, simple manner and actually apply what they learned to instigate change, whether they do it through or within a community organization or they decide to do it their own way. Comics and cartoons are never looked at as the best way to disseminate information due to the stigma that is held against them. Comics and cartoons serve a much greater role than just entertainment; when used effectively they can make learning accessible to everyone.</p>
