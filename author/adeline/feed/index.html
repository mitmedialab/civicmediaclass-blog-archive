					<description><![CDATA[The subject at hand is activism, especially the slacktivism, which according to Gladwell is a powerful mechanism to engage, motivate critical populations and the powerless to collaborate and to coordinate an action. The success of an action can only be assessed if the goals are clear and, necessarily, the purpose of any action within this context is to address a problem and thus to challenge the [state of affairs]. His arguments are about how deeply &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/29/what-kinds-of-risks-and-what-deeply-rooted-problems-actually-mean/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The online social movement that I´m going to address is the “Vem pra Rua Brasil” (Come to the streets, Brazil), that helped to bring 210,000 people to the streets of Sao Paulo in March 15, according to the Datafolha institute (not counting the thousands in other capitals), and I´m going to describe how I was fooled by it. While doing this, I´ll try to identify how the uses of social media involved the classic principles &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/22/the-vem-pra-rua-brasil-movement-and-its-strategies-to-bring-together-people-without-shared-purposes/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thinking about Jenkins&#8217; approach to a participatory culture, which involves some skills for a full involvement, such as negotiation, collective intelligence, appropriation, among others, and the five forms of inequality identified by DiMaggio and Hargittai (2001), an inclusive civic technology should be able to foster these skills, since they are not found in many communities. It has more to do with education and cultural environment… According to Edgar Morin, for instance, a revolution of the &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/01/still-glimpsing-an-inclusive-civic-technology/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

Firstly, I´d like to return to something that was stated in the last week´s readings: that the roots of PD (Participatory Design) were in the 60s, with the growth of the “Norwegian Industrial Democracy Project” (ref: ASARO). And then you´ll see what this has to do with my final project proposal. Design, in its essence (if one can use that term), is participatory.

					<description><![CDATA[First example: Stringwire.com is a platform of videos created by users with a smartphone, and made avaliable to the public in real time. NBC News bought this platform to gain a foothold in the digital news space. It also allows people to share videos in their social networks.
