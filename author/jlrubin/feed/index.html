					<description><![CDATA[Thereâ€™s a problem brewing in America: the American way of life is facing an attack which could shred the fundamental liberties and rights enjoyed by its citizens to pieces. This attack is multifaceted, and comes not in the form of boots on the ground, but a misalignment on the fundamental tenets of what is required for free and open society. Civic participation is down. Mistrust in the institutions which define our society is up, and &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/13/the-combine-2/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) &#8220;Where activists were once defined by their causes, they are now defined by their tools.&#8221; &#160; Yes, of course. It&#8217;s not like we call them &#8220;picketers&#8221; because they use sticks for their signs. &#160; 2) &#8220;Innovators tend to be solipsists. They often want to cram every stray fact and experience into their new model.&#8221; &#8230; and you sir tend to be a lexicomane. Excuse us while we save the world. &#160; 3) &#8220;Fifty years &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/25/703/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I hear the word activist, I usually think of a passionately good-willed young adult holding a sign shouting at the top of their lungs. Of course, my stereotypical image is a dated view because much of the activism today happens online &#8212; where keyboards and monitors replace cardboard signs and the clicking of keys rings louder than the physical voice. My view is not only off target for this reason, but also the image &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/22/isis/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Space exploration is one of the grandest feats mankind has pursued. Jimmy Carter, 39th President of the United States, sent the following message with the Voyager spacecraft: This Voyager spacecraft was constructed by the United States of America. We are a community of 240 million human beings among the more than 4 billion who inhabit the planet Earth. We human beings are still divided into nation states, but these states are rapidly becoming a single &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/01/space-the-ultimate-civic-technology/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#8217;s the safest speed to travel on a freeway? If you guessed the speed limit, you&#8217;re probably wrong! There is pretty strong evidence to suggest that the safest speed to travel is the speed the other cars are traveling. ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/06/texas_85_mile_per_hour_speed_limit_do_higher_speed_limits_cause_more_accidents_.html ) However, the cheapest speed to travel is definitely at or below the speed limit, because of aggressive police speed ticketing. For instance, Hampton, Florida (and a couple other small towns) had formed a &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/10/collaborative-waze-to-fix-flaws-in-government/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The idea is simple. The ramifications are not. &#160; Twitch Plays Pokemon (http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon) is, by some rough measure, a digital public sphere. The essential idea is that we hook up a Gameboy emulator up to the game streaming service Twitch, and allow the comments entered to control the buttons. In the parlance, it was super-effective. &#160; &#160; Almost overnight, thousands of people were playing. It was madness. But it worked. &#160; You must watch (at &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/03/a-new-era-of-democracy-twitch-plays-pokemon/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At 3:50 I briskly walked through central square to a small cafe tucked away on a side street. There were 5 of gathered around a low-set coffee-table: two consultants, two MIT Course 6 Juniors, and a Northeastern CS sophomore on Co-Op. One of the consultants was female, the rest of us male. All were &#8216;white&#8217;. Our conversation quickly delved into deep territory. We talked about motivations, happiness, and dreams. I won&#8217;t go too detailed here: &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/22/tea-with-strangers-part-2/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam identifies a collapse in American community as a major civic crisis. The essence of this crisis is that Americans no longer engage with one another through activities (such as bowling groups &#8212; hence the title), which has diminished the country&#8217;s social capital, or value in its social network. In order to rejuvenate America, people must engage in activities which increase Bridging, or connections between differing types of people. Putnam argues &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/22/tea-with-strangers-part-1/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An overly broad definition of citizen journalism is reporting and investigation performed by a member of a group about or pertaining to the group to which they are a member of. There are several key attributes which can be applied to narrow this definition to something smaller, but more useful. Topics: The first way in which we can narrow the definition is by restricting the topic to items relevant to current events, policy, or government. &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/17/patriots-day/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
