					<description><![CDATA[Abstract Chat rooms can be highly toxic. They are the frequent haunt of trolls and spammers. This is especially true for chat rooms connected to live video streams. But chat rooms are also one of the only places where viewers can discuss what they are seeing in real time with a group of people who are all seeing the same thing. Communities form around chat rooms, and they sometimes develop their own unique culture and &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/12/building-a-better-chat-room/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Recently the Guardian announced they were starting a campaign aimed at generating action on issues contributing to global warming. This is an interesting case study for digital activism for several reasons, one being that it is rare that a news organization publicly announces that it will champion a particular cause. If part of the current crisis in journalism is public skepticism about news organizations that try to adopt a neutral voice and are therefore perceived &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/21/the-guardians-global-climate-change-campaign/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Promise Tracker is a tool predicated partly on the idea of participatory citizenship. It requires a group of citizens who have an area of interest that they want to document or poll people about. After creating a survey they must go out into the community and talk to people and collect evidence about their area of interest. After gathering this data they are able to use it to form a narrative that they can use &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/07/the-promise-of-tracking-and-models-of-citizenship/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Creating an ideal inclusive civic technology is not easy. There are some questions that seem to require compromise no matter what the answer is. The use of anonymous or real names is one such question. Anonymity will generally encourage more people to participate, especially in places where the government may be monitoring citizen activity online. The trade-off with anonymity may be civility. The use of real names probably encourages more considered dialog because comments will &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/31/designing-for-inclusivity-and-fun/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As the network speeds of a region’s cellular data infrastructure increase, so does the viability of livestreaming quality video from a mobile phone. From the US to Ukraine and beyond people are increasingly using livestreaming to document and report on local events. My final project will look at a subset of livestreamers, who I identify as “civic livestreamers,” and describe a new platform I have been researching and designing to augment and enhance their efforts &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/17/re-imagining-civic-livestreaming/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[SeeClickFix position themselves as a platform that facilitates communication between government and citizens. Their website states that “SeeClickFix is a communications platform for citizens to report non-emergency issues, and governments to track, manage, and reply&#8211;ultimately making communities better through transparency, collaboration, and cooperation.” Looking at its functionality, the website incorporates elements of gamification by giving points to people for reporting, commenting and voting on issues, and displays point totals next to profile names in the &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/10/seeclickfix-may-be-useful-but-it-doesnt-reinvent-government/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes digital public spheres are built with the intention of democratizing what information gets prioritized by creating upvote/downvote systems that drive what information appears on the front page of a website. Such systems are generally viewed as fostering equality (everyone gets to vote on each piece of information if they want to) and openness or transparency (vote totals are usually displayed next to the items). It’s tempting to think of these platforms as a way &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/03/manipulating-algorithms-for-advantage-in-a-public-sphere/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One indicator of civic (and political) crisis beyond a U.S. context is post-election violence. It can be the result of many factors, including the expression of long-simmering tension between rival factions, anger over lack of economic opportunity, or a breakdown in trust between political or ethnic groups, especially if there are allegations of vote-rigging. The 2007 post-election violence in Kenya is one example of this. After Mwai Kibaki declared victory, opposition leader Raila Odinga and &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/24/post-election-violence-as-a-civic-crisis/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People who stream live video from their mobile phones can be a compelling example of citizen journalism. But it is not always clear if and when a live streamer can actually be called a citizen journalist. Just because someone pulls out their phone and starts streaming, does that make them a citizen journalist? It depends on what they are streaming. I would argue that acts of citizen journalism can often be identified by asking the &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/17/live-streamers-and-citizen-journalism/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
