					<description><![CDATA[Abstract Proposes a new online legal knowledge system that would be free to use and targeted at ease of accessibility. The harms of legal ignorance are explored, and issues of equality in the status quo are raised. The benefits of general legal knowledge for society are also explored and used to motivate the proposal. A legal ontology tailored to this project is established. Some specifics of the system are elaborated upon and analyzed in the &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/12/webjd-a-legal-knowledge-system-with-a-civic-purpose/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Malcom Gladwell is right. I don’t think he’s quite as right as he thinks he is, but he hits the nail on the head when he argues that networked movements are inherently bad at affecting structural change. To crystallize his analysis, is in generally true that “The Internet” (please excuse the personification) can do whatever “The Internet” sets its mind to: investigations, electoral campaigns, journalism, whistleblowing, etc. What holds it back from solving all the &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/28/gladwell-calls-it-on-structural-problems/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) is an organization founded in 1999 by a professor and a civil rights lawyer, both civil libertarians, to “…defend and sustain individual rights at America’s colleges and universities.” They currently spend that vast majority of their resources tackling the issue of student and faculty speech on campuses though publicity campaigns, strategic litigation, and other legal avenues.

					<description><![CDATA[Before I discuss the power of a technology like Rynda, I’d first like to spend a paragraph or three in (poorly-researched) defense of the personal responsibility model of citizenship, whose cardinal sin in my view is historically poor implementation rather than any inherent flaw. The goal of the personal responsibility model of citizenship is to instill in the citizenry the idea that the benefits afforded by membership in society also carry an ethical obligation to &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/07/rynda-and-personal-responsibility-citizenship/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Which is more inclusive, Disneyland or a traveling carnival? To participate in Disneyland, you must buy an expensive admission ticket, which puts entry out of reach for many who cannot afford the fee. But once inside, everyone has equal access to all of the rides and attractions. (Almost) no one has any inherent advantage at enjoying Disneyland simply because they are white or rich. This type of activity is inclusive in the Habermasian sense—once inside, &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/31/inclusiveity-disneyland-vs-the-carnival/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The problem: I have great respect for the US judicial system. It is set up as an adversarial system with endless procedural rules and avenues of appeal, all for the express purpose of ensuring a fair outcome for everyone involved. While no human institution is entirely without fault, and the judicial system is in no way immune to pervasive implicit social effects, I am a firm believer that the US judicial system is one of &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/17/427/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In an earlier blog post, I talked about the problem of police oversight and proposed a new technology to help solve it. I argued that the fundamental problem was one of incentive: police have very little incentive to document their own wrongdoing. The idea behind my proposed technology was to empower the people, who do have an incentive to document police wrongdoing. Now on the topic of collaborative technology that seeks to improve government, I &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/10/copwatch-redux/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In The Purge (2013), James DeMonaco attempts to show a world where, for one night a year, people are allowed to do whatever they want with no formal consequences. It is a horror film. But does the lack of consequences for one&#8217;s actions really have the power to turn ordinary people into savages?

					<description><![CDATA[Last August saw the historic events of the Michael Brown shooting unfold in dramatic fashion on the streets of Ferguson and in headlines across the country. They brought up a very old conversation, police race relations, with a renewed sense of urgency. At its heart, this issue is a crisis of confidence in the trustworthiness of the police—a major problem for an institution that exists to serve the people and relies on their support.

					<description><![CDATA[While it is relatively easy to find examples of citizen journalism and examples of non-citizen journalism, unambiguously defining the term itself is no trivial feat. On a linguistic level, we can understand it as some sort of sub-activity of “journalism,” which of course begs the question: what is journalism? Here I turn to a well-known phrase of dubious origin: “Journalism is the first rough draft of history.” Apart from being pithy and elegant, this phrase is &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/15/mcole-on-citizen-journalism/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
