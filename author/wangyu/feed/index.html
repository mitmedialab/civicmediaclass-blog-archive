					<description><![CDATA[It is nearly impossible to find a single inclusive civic technology that suits all my needs. This is because some needs may conflict with others, and additional attributes are needed for a technology to survive and reach a critical mass. Hereby I will provide the “shopping list” for civic technologies and potential candidates in this civic technology competition. 1. This technology needs to be cheap enough so people from most social classes can afford. 2. &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/30/shopping-list-for-civic-technology/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sina Weibo is often referred as the “Chinese Twitter”. However, when compared to twitter, Sina Weibo has more attributes of a public sphere, here’s some reason why: 1. the tweet limit is 140 Chinese characters. That could express a lot of meaning in Chinese. Besides, lots of people stuff a long article as an image. Longer content makes deliberation possible.

					<description><![CDATA[When talking about civic crisis, I was thinking what is the civic crisis in China, or is there a civic crisis in China? In summary, there are three types of civic crisis discussed in this class; 1. People (especially young students) are lack of basic knowledge (arguably) required in public life; 2. People no longer care about politics, and they do not show up in votes. 3. People no longer gather in community meetings such &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/24/the-civic-merits-of-baidu-tieba-or-posting-cafe/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you start a Google search for &#8220;citizen journalism&#8221;, mostly it will lead to Bowman and Wills&#8217; definition (maybe just because somebody wrote this on the Wikipedia). My definition is much simpler: it needs to be citizen-driven, and it should be journalism. In particular, the more a activity responses to journalism needs, sticks to journalism value, engage citizen participation, the more compelling it is as a form of citizen journalism. In this sense, I think &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/16/10-reasons-why-mobile-phone-cameras-is-the-most-compelling-form-of-citizen-journalism/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
