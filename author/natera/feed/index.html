					<description><![CDATA[In an era full of advertising, how do we get the best information about political candidates Trying to get that could be hard, and it’s harder to remember what they were doing some years ago and what other public jobs they held. The answers to these questions could help citizens make a more informed choice. Monitor Electoral (Electoral Monitor) is a site to visualize in one place political candidates&#8217; history, platforms, and proposals.

					<description><![CDATA[The main argument of Gladwell is based in the strength of the ties of the networks, he argues that the social movements that are based on strong ties could perform better and accomplish something more significant than the ones that are based on weak ties, the main difference between them as Gladwell put it is the use of internet and digital social networks, but that couldn&#8217;t be that simple. I agree with him that internet &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/28/networks-and-social-movements/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last September Mexico was shocked with the news of the kidnapping of 43 rural students of the Ayotzinapa Rural School in Guerrero, one of the poorest states in the country. Unfortunately hearing of disappearances, kidnapping, shootings and violence in the country has been something &#8220;normal&#8221; for the last years, with the &#8220;drug on wars&#8221; since 2006 the violence has scaled. But even in a country where we left counting gun shoots, the disappearance of 43 students was &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/21/ayotzinapa-and-social-media/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The ideal civic technology for me would be one that is affordable to anyone, not only for their price, but also for their convenience of use and for their learning curve, it should also be widely spread and as transparent as it could be. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s one technology that could be THE civic technology, but I could think about some examples of technologies that help the citizens and that get some of the &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/31/504/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For my final project I&#8217;m working in a platform to monitor municipal elections in Guadalajara, the aim of the project is to concentrate information about the candidates, gathering the history of them, how did they performed in public positions, how much does they were earning in each public position, etc. One of the main problems that we have in Mexico is that we don&#8217;t have &#8220;public memory&#8221; of our politicians, we see faces and hear &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/17/monitoring-municipal-elections/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the flaws that we are having in Mexico is the lack of public information, not just open data, but also whist-blower information. Form the open data side there has been a movement from the civil society they started with Codeando México and Datamx.io, the platform gain attention from different governments and eventually the federal government launched a dedicated site for open data. But on the side of investigative journalism and government accountability there hasn&#8217;t &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/10/whistleblowing-in-the-networked-sphere/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

One of their goals is to awake the citizens to work for a better society. The CIC takes advantage of mobile technologies to enable the citizens to generate reports about the city and send them to the authorities.

					<description><![CDATA[How could &#8220;Citizen Journalism&#8221; be defined? The term refers to two broader concepts, to narrow it I&#8217;m going to refer to the ten elements of journalism that Kovach and Rosenstiel enlist in the Introduction of &#8220;Elements of Journalism&#8221;: Journalism&#8217;s first obligation is the truth Its first loyalty is to the citizens Its essences is a discipline of verification Its practitioners must maintain an independence from those they cover It must serve as an independent monitor of power &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/16/58/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
