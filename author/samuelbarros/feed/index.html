					<description><![CDATA[Activism has a strong tradition in pushing societies to recognize new rights and making pressure in governments to respect citizens. Thus, activism means a method to spread progressive ideas. However, the latest news from Brazil call me to think about possible negative effects of this political practice. Nowadays, Brazil is living under an economic crisis. I mean the economic growth rates are close to zero. At the same time, there is a big corruption scandal &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/22/online-activism-is-always-good/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rio de Janeiro is probably the most known Brazilian city around the world. The city image is shaped by natural beauties, Bossa Nova, samba, carnival, the big statue of Christ the Redeemer [o Cristo Redentor] and the Pão de Açucar Mountain. (Of course we may not forget some sad things that is also part of the city, like the urban violence and inappropriate housing in favelas). Rio de Janeiro is both one important city for &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/07/keep-attention-on-the-trolley-social-monitoring-and-engagement-in-rio-de-janeiro-brazil/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The civic media projects need to be able to include everyone who want to engage. However, to translate the theoretical demands for inclusiveness on the real world is really complex. A historical example are the efforts of governments and social organizations to facilitate public access to the Internet. In the United States, there is policies to offer Internet access in public libraries and some cities are planning to offer free high-speed Internet for all citizens. &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/01/online-inclusiveness-as-a-democratic-value-the-participa-br-case/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, I would like to remember some key points in Benkler’s work. He understands that the collaboration between individuals in the common space (or networked public sphere, in some assumptions) can result in public goods. This is a generous idea, but it is also real and economic-based, as he demonstrated rigorously in his book. The Benkler’s perspective recognizes that human beings generally act motived by capital or material gains, but at same time &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/11/collaboration-between-tool-builders/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[idea in progress] How can we do a strong online public sphere? How can we create a space to citizens discuss with others and to influence the police making process, both parliamentary and governmental? This is a really important and hard question. Probably there is no an effective prescription for all contexts. Actually, since the first steps of the internet, scholars and activists are trying to figure out how to use this technology to enhance &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/04/what-can-the-civic-media-projects-do-for-public-sphere/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to talk about one of the most complex problems in modern democracies: the crisis of representation. There is no consensus about causes, consequences and solutions to this crisis, but every citizen in modern democracies strives for more and better political representation. Everyone wants to see members of parliament discuss the issues they consider most important. I am not going to ask if representative democracy is the best option. This is an important &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/24/civic-media-as-a-way-to-improve-the-relationship-between-citizens-and-political-representatives/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People with different backgrounds has talked about citizen journalism. There is a lot of conceptions and practical applications. From reader’s comments in mainstream newspapers to independent blogs have claimed to themselves the umbrella of citizen journalism. However, what is the fundamental element in this concept? The most common and simpler answer is: “citizen journalism is the journalism made by the citizens”. This is true, but is this a satisfactory answer? Citizen journalism is not only &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/17/citizen-journalism-as-a-cultural-challenge/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
