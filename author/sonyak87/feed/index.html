					<description><![CDATA[What I have noticed is that unless you have specific technical skills, it&#8217;s very difficult to create new technologies. However depending on the learning curve, you can use many different kinds of technologies. Technological inclusivity has many layers to it. You can use a technology even if you didn&#8217;t design the technology. For many people with a certain level of digital exposure, you can utilize a lot of technologies.

					<description><![CDATA[As an anxious person with a thrill for hypochondria, I sometimes use the internet as a way of diagnosing myself with various ailments. But I&#8217;m not alone. According to the latest Pew Research Center Health Fact Sheet, 72% of internet users say they looked online for health information within the past year (this was in 2012) and 35% of U.S. adults say that at one time or another they have gone online specifically to try to figure &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/03/digital-public-health-sphere/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

In this entry, I will talk specifically about political representation in the United States. Although a seemingly never ending crisis historically and globally (I haven’t read enough critical political theory to know if there have been any real examples of “pure representation”) I find that in the United States today there is an &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/24/political-representation/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[Disclaimer: Global Voices intrigued me before I realized Ethan Zuckerman was a co-founder. I tried very hard to find another example to explain my definition of citizen journalism but I wasn’t able to]. Citizen journalism is a form of journalism where the public is the reporter, editor, publisher, and reader that has the intention of being a public good.
