					<description><![CDATA[I propose a platform for civic data analysis based on the MIT CSAIL project DataHub. DataHub is a GitHub for data, allowing users to follow other users and their data analysis projects and fork others’ projects to extend them. It provides an ecosystem of composable applications for data ingestion, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. I argue that DataHub’s centralization of datasets and analyses on a single platform, support for extension of others’ analyses, and emphasis &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/13/civic-data-analysis-with-datahub/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As mentioned in class, I think Gladwell is trying to create a false dichotomy between in-person, strong-tie based organizing and its social media counterpart. There is no reason why the two cannot complement one another as part of a single organizing effort. I completely agree that strong ties are required to inspire the vast majority of people to take large risks; I personally would be very unlikely to participate in a sit-in unless at least &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/28/gladwells-false-dichotomy/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By the start of the second decade of the 2000’s, Egyptians were tiring of dictator Hosni Mubarak’s rule. Unemployment was high, police brutality was on the rise, and elections were rigged. As access to the Internet and social media in Egypt grew, citizens gained a newfound ability to voice their grievances, and the discontent that had been brewing in Egypt for decades finally came to a head. The story of Wael Ghonim is particularly telling. &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/21/wael-ghonim-and-the-egyptian-revolution-of-2011/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I consider CodeCademy and other websites that teach computer programming to be fantastic examples of inclusive civic technology. Our readings from last week talked about how now digital inequality is not defined by differences in access to technology, but rather in literacy, so I feel that inclusive civic technology should seek to promote digital literacy. Full participation in the digital public sphere requires considerable technical sophistication. For example, it may be important for digital citizens &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/31/codecademy-the-importance-of-programming/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to propose a system for collaborative analysis of datasets important to large publics. We are in the age of big data – sensors and trackers are everywhere, whether in physical locations or in software applications, and they generate huge volumes of data. A large variety of tools have been built to deal with the data explosion, in particular systems for data storage and computation across a cluster of computers. However, many of &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/17/civic-data-analysis/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A common complaint about the U.S. government is that lawmakers, cooped up in their offices in Washington, D.C., are ignorant of many of the most pressing issues facing the American people. They spend hours debating bills that don’t address fundamental problems, and there is no way for citizens to collectively inform them that they are off track. As more and more people began to draw attention to the potential of the Internet to connect citizens &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/10/we-the-people/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I consider Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com) to be a high-quality digital public sphere. Run by the prestigious seed-stage incubator Y Combinator, Hacker News surfaces user-submitted links and posts using an upvote and downvote system and allows users to comment on submitted content. Here is a screenshot of part of the front page: In general, the content focuses on matters relating to the software engineering community, including news of startup funding and acquisitions, hot technical topics such &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/03/hacker-news/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the most important civic crises in the U.S. is the declining interest in voting. In the November 2014 midterm elections, only 36.4% of eligible voters participated, the lowest rate since World War II. Even participation rates for presidential elections are about 5-10% lower today than they were 50 years ago. The reasons for this decline are hotly debated. Many researchers claim that the rise of personal technology like televisions and computers has isolated &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/24/facebook-and-voter-turnout/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I define citizen journalism to be any sort of writing about matters of significance beyond the self performed by individuals not paid for their work. With this definition in mind, I find Quora to be a compelling example of citizen journalism. Quora is a question and answer website that allows users to submit questions of interest and categorize them, request that certain individuals answer specific questions, and, of course, answer questions themselves. This model is &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/17/citizen-journalism-on-quora/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
