					<description><![CDATA[Concerns over two particular problems with American society have grown over the recent years. The first and perhaps more broadly evident is the volatility of the economy. The Great Recession and the feeble job market that accompanied it shook the faith that many held in the nation’s markets and financial institutions. An ever-widening wealth gap has not helped to reinstate any of the confidence that was lost, and a government that has proved at many times &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/13/mint-it-yourself-making-complementary-currencies-more-compelling/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gladwell finds fault with the idea of social media being transformative to how activism is done. High-risk activities that actually effect change, he insists, rely on “strong-tie” relationships – bonds that usually form from lengthy face-to-face interactions fostered by physical proximity. The friendships that result are what give people the inspiration necessary to participate in activities where they face the possibility of arrest, violence, or even death. The claim that the “weak-tie” networks generated by &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/26/rynda-and-isis-and-linux-oh-my-activism-beyond-how-gladwell-sees-it/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There’s oftentimes a fine line between social justice and vigilantism. The internet has made both information collection and sharing quick and effortless, allowing for social movements to spread rapidly while lowering the barrier needed to participate. This, however, means that masses of well-intentioned people working towards change can end up focusing their vitriol on a few defenseless and mostly undeserving individuals who happen to be so unlucky as to have insulted the sensibilities of the &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/18/off-color-activism-when-a-campaign-goes-wrong/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Monithon, its name a contraction of the words monitor and marathon, is citizen-based monitoring effort in Italy that seeks to evaluate the success of local projects funded by the EU. Small groups of volunteers, sometimes from the Monithon development team and otherwise comprised of concerned citizens, assess the progress of projects and identify potential problems as they crop up. Finding projects to watch over is made easy due to OpenCoesione, a government-initiated open data portal &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/07/monithon-heavy-on-the-participatory-less-so-on-the-justice-oriented/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Creating usable, flexible, and inclusive platforms for civic media remains an incipient struggle; any working example even halfway close to the ideal civic technology is at least a couple decades’ worth of design innovations and adaptation hurdles away. Nevertheless, a good idea of what this might entail can be garnered by sampling extant creations that perform remarkably well for certain functions. The resulting chimera that would emerge from assembling these various traits would be somewhat &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/30/putting-everything-together/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Great Recession has nominally ended but faith in the economy remains to be restored. Shaken by the experiences of previous years, many Americans have begun to seek alternatives to the standard U.S. dollar, citing the advantages of autonomy and insulation from the national market. Of these non-standard currencies, the one that has received by far the most attention from the press has been Bitcoin, due to the controversy surrounding its facilitation of less than &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/18/making-local-currencies-easy/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Change.org was launched in February of 2007. Since then it has taken great care to balance delicately its existence as a for-profit organization and its role as a platform for collective action. The flaw in government that it seeks to correct is that of responsiveness and consumer representation. Its way of doing this is simple. Individuals or users start their own petitions on the website; their target is contacted through email to notify them that &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/08/change-org-making-slacktivism-effective/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When the public approaches Wikipedia it is with a caution usually reserved for miracles: two parts amazement, one part suspicion. It seems unbelievable that such a comprehensive and remarkably well-written collection of encyclopedia entries could have originated from the frenzied throes of anarchic crowd-editing. Yet as much as we are beseeched to not rely on Wikipedia as an authoritative source of information, it is unquestionably the default go-to for almost all non-critical fact-searching.

					<description><![CDATA[I remain unconvinced that there is a growing crisis in civics. Ours schools may be woefully incompetent at educating students on the fundamentals of our nation’s government and history; there is no indication, however, that this problem at the present is any worse than it has been at any point in time. Likewise, it’s probably true that younger generations have little to no inclination of joining the musty old ranks of institutions such as the &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/24/webapp-for-government-relevance/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Take your pick of any of the major events of 2014 and you would be hard-pressed to choose one that did not involve citizen journalism. This past year, ordinary individuals often equipped with nothing more than cell phone cameras reported on and at times changed the course of national and international affairs. From the streets of Ferguson came footage of billowing tear gas and heavily militarized riot police; from Crimea, reports of troops bearing Russian &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/17/reporting-on-reporting/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
