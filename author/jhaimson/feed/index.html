					<description><![CDATA[Abstract: Habermas&#8217; public sphere is a critical architectural component of democracies around the world. In this paper, I argue that while the public sphere is important, the psychology literature dictates that the public sphere could never have existed as the ideal discursive space ruled by reason that Habermas described. I then argue that the phenomenon of denialism, where large amounts of people reject the scientific consensus on an issue, is the result of an exploitation &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/13/the-thanksgiving-playbook-a-tool-to-combat-denialism-and-help-you-win-thanksgiving-debates/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In “Small Change,” Malcolm Gladwell seems to throw a wrench in the dreams of techno-utopians who claim to have solved the problems of civil society through networked computers.  And he makes a compelling case.  The crux of his argument rests upon differences in classes of interpersonal connections, the differences between what he calls “weak-ties” and “strong-ties.”  Gladwell masterfully paints a comparison between two very different kinds of activism where these different types of connections draw &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/29/connected-movements-lowering-standards-rather-than-stifling-progress/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In March of 2012, I was 17 years old and a senior in high school.  I remember sitting in class when as one of my friends, who was 16 years old at the time, was making a powerpoint presentation in front of the class on a man named Joseph Kony.  She talked for a while about the horrible atrocities Kony had committed and the thousands of children he had abducted and murdered.  She then proposed &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/22/kony-2012-when-organizing-goes-viral/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I consider an inclusive civic technology, it must satisfy the following three criteria: The technology must be free to the end user. The technology must require minimal dependency costs. The technology must have minimal time and effort costs on its end users so that all people can use it regardless of their other time commitments or level of education. The technology must not have any norms about who uses it or why they use &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/31/which-is-more-inclusive-lawn-signs-street-art-or-bumper-stickers/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My project proposal lays at the intersection of a couple different phenomena: discoveries in social psychology and behavioral economics, the prevalence of denialism on important issues in society and the emergence of the networked public sphere. To understand why, let’s look at each of these phenomena individually. The Nudge Unit In 2010, the UK government established the Behavioral Insights Team, colloquially dubbed ‘The Nudge Unit.’ Their goal was simple: save the UK government money.

					<description><![CDATA[One of the oldest services that governments have provided their citizens is the construction and maintenance of roads. To make life better for those who use roads, some of the most modern governments have begun using state of the art technology to notify drivers of their status, enabling them to plan around things like construction or traffic-causing accidents. One such high-tech solution can be seen below: &#160; AM radio, a state of the art technology &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/11/waze-to-improve-roads-and-track-citizens/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahh the irony. Conversations about how Habermas’ notion of ‘The Public Sphere’ comes into play in the digital age… on a digital platform where communities can come together to discuss issues like whether or not digital platforms contribute to the notion of ‘The Public Sphere’. Quora, although mentioned already in a previous blog post, seems to me like a great choice for a digital public sphere that does a good job in the categories of &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/04/quora/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[According to a Pew Research poll, the share of Americans who claim no particular religion went from 7% in the 1990s to 20% in 2012 (and 33% within the 18-30 demographic) [1]. This massive trend away from religiosity in America’s youth poses an interesting challenge for civics. In America, religion has always been about more than God – the church (used here and for the rest of this post in the metonymic sense) has been &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/24/the-sunday-assembly-church-without-dogma/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On March 3 1991, a manager at a plumbing and rooting company by the name of George Holliday awoke to sirens outside of his Los Angeles apartment. With the help of a Sony Handycam, Holliday began filming what would soon become fodder for national protests, riots and debates – the beating of Rodney King by multiple officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. After receiving unsatisfactory information from the police about why the star of &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/18/ill-believe-it-when-i-see-it-the-democratization-of-credibility/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
