					<description><![CDATA[The networked public sphere is today’s most active domain of public debate. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and a number of micro-spheres in the form of comment sections on news sites and blogs provide a platform unlike open societies have ever seen. Debate rages on the internet, thanks to significantly open exposure of ideas, and at least the potential of finding ideas far divergent from one’s own. There were hopes early on in the days of &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/13/pairwise-empathy-socio-structural-interventions-for-the-networked-public-sphere/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Actualizing Citizen as Action Path User Appealing to the community volunteering and community action propensities of the AC, Action Path creates a space that allows for distributed, ad-hoc participation in civic and community issues; what Bennet describes as “loose networks of community action”[1]. Self-Actualizing Citizenship values a sense of agency that is felt primarily when participation is not run through a hierarchical governmental authority structure. In Action Path, there exists the potential for a &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/08/contingent-engagement-in-action-path/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Social networks are pervasive in modern human communication, and they typically provide the same or similar affordances. Speaking, liking, sharing, commenting. These provide for the very basic contours of conversation, with options for limited non-verbal engagement. So limited in fact, that expressing negativity or disagreement non-verbally is not an option. These choices are made delicately, and are tangled up with the company’s bottom line. Take for instance the Facebook decision to avoid including a “Dislike” &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/18/shifter-a-social-experiment-in-dynamic-social-spheres/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“State and Space” is an project created by the team at OccupyDataNYC.org that attempts to surface and address police abuse, particularly surrounding the Occupy movement. Quoting an early description by the team, State and Space attempts to “examine the frequency and nature of incidents related to interactions between the NYPD and the Occupy movement, including the use of tactics intended to harm peaceful protesters, identity-based discrimination, other abuses of power and benevolence.” [1] 30,000+ tweets &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/11/state-and-space/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Far from an uncontested term, the potential definitions for citizen journalism span a number of gamuts. There is the affiliative range, along which examples of journalism range from the independent citizen to one publishing in partnership on a conventional news organization’s platform with their editorial review. There is also the range of professionalism, where an individual could have no experience presenting news to an audience (e.g. the bystanders who filmed the Charlie Hebdo attacks posting &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/18/conflict-kitchen-as-a-rich-form-of-citizen-journalism/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
