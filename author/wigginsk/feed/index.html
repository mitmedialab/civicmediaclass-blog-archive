					<description><![CDATA[Throughout the course of history, there have been so many things that has separated humankind. Whether it was race or language, these man made classifications have mainly been used to further separate humanity. One aspect of human culture that has managed to transcend this is music. Music is one of the most diverse fields yet musicians are still able to come together and understand one other thanks to hearing each other play. It wasn’t until &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/12/music-for-change/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gladwell proposes a well thought out argument that I, for the most part, agree with. As a child and even now, when I envision an activist, I don&#8217;t think of somebody sitting behind a computer voicing their opinion online. I think of someone who is willing to dedicate their time and energy to voice their opinion through physical actions. Digital activism is not effective unless there are people who are willing to put in the &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/28/what-really-is-activism/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As society progresses and improves, the role and impact technology has on our lives will increase. Technology has even altered the way people look to spark change. In the 1900s, media was nowhere near as complex as it is today. Radios, and later on television, were the main source for broadcasting one&#8217;s opinion on an issue in hopes of inciting change. Even though these forms of mass media are considered limited by today&#8217;s standards, they &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/21/occupy-wall-street-changing-the-way-we-see-protests/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The example of monitorial citizenship that I want to discuss in this blog post is Textizen. Capitalizing on the reality that the majority of the American population has a phone, Textizen sends text messages to help its users spread their message. Through these text messages, users can inform a greater audience about a topic or event as well as collect data regarding the topic. This feature of the website allows users to establish a loop where they can &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/07/textizen-redefining-sms/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In my opinion, civic technology can be split up into two sections. The first of these categories would essentially be a partnership between the government and the people. To begin, the government would put up issues that they would like for citizens to offer their input on. With the government overseeing the discussion, people can offer their ideas and show their support or their disapproval for a certain idea. In order to prevent a frenzy &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/01/by-the-people-and-for-the-people/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was coming up with an idea for a case study, I did not have an idea as to what I wanted to analyze. I began to play some of my favorite songs and started to perform research on some issues I believed interested me. Then it hit me; why not research the very thing that I am using to inspire me, music.

					<description><![CDATA[For this week&#8217;s assignment, I thought it would be best to look at some of the initiatives taken by various government websites to employ Benkler&#8217;s Gov 2.0. I came across a website that I had heard of before but never actually took the time to look at- http://www.ny.gov/. At first glance, http://www.ny.gov/ looked like exactly what Benkler called for. When you first enter the site, you see various issues and are allowed to show your &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/10/is-the-government-ready-for-gov-2-0/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ever since I could remember, my family has frowned upon online shopping. I didn&#8217;t understand why my family hated it and whenever I asked why, I was always given the &#8220;you&#8217;re a child and I&#8217;m an adult so listen to whatever I say&#8221; look. When I finally began making my own money and decided how I wanted to spend it, I began laughing at my family.

					<description><![CDATA[When I began thinking about citizen journalism, all I could envision was the most honorable examples. Examples that included people dedicating themselves to improving society through altruistic acts. When thinking about it some more, I began to realize that citizen journalism doesn’t necessarily have to be performed by the most unselfish people; citizen journalism is literally journalism performed by citizens. It is when average, ordinary citizens with their own flaws and problems decide to spread &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/17/an-unlikely-source-of-journalism/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
