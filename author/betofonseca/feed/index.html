					<description><![CDATA[(Read the full project paper here) There is a buddhist proverb that say “the more you have, the more suffering it will cause”, as one will probably worry eternally about losing the possession in question. When I move to my apartment in Sao Paulo, in 2003, I was not aware of that, but loved the silence around: from the seventh floor, I could hear water running on the street at night. Seven years later, a &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/12/silence-or-how-can-a-group-of-voices-help-control-urban-noise/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite being pulverized by Germany at home during the last World Cup, Brazil champions soccer as the country&#8217;s main sport for decades. Among its critics, it is a common saying that &#8220;if people discussed politics as much and with such memory and detail as they do with soccer, the situation would be infinitely better than it is nowadays&#8221;, as it would provide citizens that are at the same time informed to know how many times &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/04/08/pec-may-be-appealing-as-a-dribble-but-misses-the-goal-of-what-makes-good-politics/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It took me the noise caused by a World Snow Mobile Expo in West Yellowstone, Montana, to remember how annoying can be to live in a high decibel environment. That, however, was not the first time it happened: the construction of a building a few meters from where I lived in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and a clumsy local regulation on trucks deliveries took away countless hours of sleep for three years. Both experiences inspired me &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/31/the-sound-of-silence/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#160; It was curious to research what Sao Paulo, the city I used to live in, has been doing over the last months for improving its relation with the citizens through the Internet. Perhaps the first thing that caught my attention was the lack of uniformity: there are sites with a brutal technological gap and unusual solutions and others with bold and interesting fresh new ideas. Unfortunately, the first one crossed my way initially.

					<description><![CDATA[&#160; *a mass is the German definition of a 1-liter glass mug. My friend is a true believer that the world would be a better place if Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were still alive – and in charge. He also considers Über a great idea because “it is free from the State regulations and thus, if you want to work 16 hours a day, it’s only up to you”. His future plans include moving &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/03/03/why-habermas-should-have-a-mass-and-rate-it-on-untappd/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After the nationwide protests in 2013 that started after the elevation of transportation fares, the optimistic political analysis pointed out young Brazilians have left their comfort zones and flocked to the streets to become more active and interested in what was being decided on their behalf. The 2014 presidential election, however, was a statistic cold shower: the total of registered voters between 16 and 17 years old &#8211; which are not forced by law to &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/25/nine-good-brazilian-civic-engagement-projects-that-arent-still-there-and-one-that-made-it/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The beginning of 2013 was a bad moment for newspapers in Sao Paulo, Brazil`s largest city. Big media groups were promoting large layoffs &#8211; that lead, for instance, to the closing of 46 year old Jornal da Tarde, where I used to work. Besides that, there was a bad vibe in the newsrooms, where the amount of work had increased for the remaining journalists, already tired of exhausting shifts and afraid of the next cuts. &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/02/17/is-ninja-media-a-part-of-the-solution-for-civic-journalism/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
