			<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>
<p>I have great respect for the US judicial system. It is set up as an adversarial system with endless procedural rules and avenues of appeal, all for the express purpose of ensuring a fair outcome for everyone involved. While no human institution is entirely without fault, and the judicial system is in no way immune to pervasive implicit social effects, I am a firm believer that the US judicial system is one of the best approximations of “fair” that humans have yet constructed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and in the US judicial system, the cost of this fairness is pretty terrible inefficiency. Those endless avenues of appeal have a bad habit of being somewhat costly, which is the main reason that capital punishment is actually <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty">more expensive</a> than life without parole in practice.</p>
<p>Some of this inefficiency is intrinsic to the process. For example, we could expedite decisions by limiting the chances of appeal, but this would directly impact an individual’s ability to seek a fair outcome. Such inefficiencies are probably not worth correcting. But there are other inefficiencies extrinsic to the process with can be corrected in ways that would augment the power of the judiciary to affect justice in the community.</p>
<p>In particular, I would like to focus on one particular extrinsic inefficiency in the judiciary: the inefficiency in connecting individuals experiencing injustice with lawyers and resources to pursue remediation.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong></p>
<p>I propose a new website called WebJD, styled similarly to the ever-popular <a href="http://www.webmd.com/default.htm">WebMD</a>. The goal is to provide individuals with access to enough information that they may autonomously decide whether their case has enough merit to warrant talking to a lawyer, thus helping these individuals connect with the help they need.</p>
<p>Pursuant to its goal of connecting people with expertise, the site would be painstakingly constructed to be easy to navigate by non-lawyers. I’m still thinking about the best ways to accomplish this, but since most legal questions among citizens tend to involve the legal relationship between some individual or group and oneself, the primary form of organization would likely be by second party. In other words, a user might begin their search by selecting from a list of {Employer, School, Businesses, Family/Friends, Strangers, City/State Government, Federal Government}.</p>
<p>Within each of these options, users could further refine their search. One hypothetical path might be “City/State Government” -&gt; “Civil actions against citizens” -&gt; “Subpoenas.” The user would then be taken to a Wikipedia-esque page on subpoenas with information about them, requirements, what typically results, etc. The website would feature a zip code-powered Lawyer Finder, and a link to the finder would be prominently displayed on the subpoena page.</p>
<p>None of this is particularly new or ground breaking. What would make WebJD unique is that it would keep track a user’s per-visit history to prioritize page results and information (perhaps with a blossom algorithm? Something similar to <a href="http://en.akinator.mobi/">Akinator</a>). The goal would be to build up a database of usage history that could be used to intuit things about the particulars of a user’s problem. This would enable WebJD to make relevant information recommendations.</p>
<p>To make this process more intuitive, effective, and transparent, the list of previously viewed pages would be included in a UI element at the top of the screen. If a user visits a page which is not relevant to their problem, they may remove it from this list so that it won’t factor into the recommendations. With a well-constructed algorithm and a deep pool of usage data to draw from, this would hopefully allow WebJD to direct users to information that they need, even if they did not know at the outset that they needed it. Needless to say, WebJD would not store any information other than that required to improve the algorithm.</p>
<p>The only remaining unknown is where WebJD would acquire its data. I will be putting some thought into this, but perhaps something as simple as scraping from Wikipedia (with appropriate attribution, of course) would be enough. As long as it is able to provide user with the information necessary to make informed decisions about when to seek legal counsel, WebJD stands to be effective in its goal.</p>

			<p>For my final project I&#8217;m working in a platform to monitor municipal elections in Guadalajara, the aim of the project is to concentrate information about the candidates, gathering the history of them, how did they performed in public positions, how much does they were earning in each public position, etc.</p>
<p>One of the main problems that we have in Mexico is that we don&#8217;t have &#8220;public memory&#8221; of our politicians, we see faces and hear names, but we don&#8217;t really know what is their history, how does the have worked, did they did it right or wrong, did they get involved in corruption scandals, what where their position in different matters.</p>
<p>Geting all the above in mind is that a group of friends and me started working in a spinoff of <a href="http://ciudadpixel.mx">CiudadPixel.mx</a> a blog that we have about cities and technology, the new feature of the blog is called <a href="http://ciudadpixel.mx/elecciones">&#8220;Monitor Electoral&#8221;</a> (Electoral monitor // Alpha version) we are getting the information from the mayoral candidates, from the basic info such as their names, to a time line of their lives, getting political issues, educational ones and other interesting information. The next steps are going to be to add some new functions such as get the proposals of each candidate in different subjects, their teams, and what does the media says about them, also to build a table to run comparisons between them, like a fact sheet for comparing cellphones or computers.</p>
<p><a href="http://ciudadpixel.mx/elecciones"><img class=" size-large wp-image-423 aligncenter" src="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Monitor-Electoral-2015-652x1024.png" alt="Monitor Electoral 2015" width="584" height="917" srcset="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Monitor-Electoral-2015-652x1024.png 652w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Monitor-Electoral-2015-191x300.png 191w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Monitor-Electoral-2015-900x1413.png 900w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Monitor-Electoral-2015.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the goals of the platform is to evolve to be open source and gain more people who are interested in participating, the idea is to be able to growth the platform to different kind of candidate not just for mayoral candidates. On the other hand this is also the beginning to build a politicians data base, where we could look up, we see some interesting opportunities in having this &#8220;public memory&#8221; where we could look back in elections campaign to have accountability on the politicians.</p>

<p>We have been talking about the social component of the platform, how could we get the people to engage with the site, how could we empower them? Those are two of the main questions we are trying to figure it out.</p>

			<p>This post is about our final project proposals.</p>
<p>Firstly, I´d like to return to something that was stated in the last week´s readings: that the roots of PD (Participatory Design) were in the 60s, with the growth of the “Norwegian Industrial Democracy Project” (ref: ASARO). And then you´ll see what this has to do with my final project proposal.</p>
<p>Design, in its essence (if one can use that term), <strong>is </strong>participatory. Taking the user into account is in the heart of this activity, of this field of knowledge. From an engineering point of view, perhaps, that thought may be relatively new. But from the perspective of design as a manifestation of human creativity, it already embraces this principle itself, intrinsically. In Bauhaus (founded in 1919), for example, which is considered a landmark of design activity, there was already a transdisciplinary approach to design and an approach that put real users at the center of the process, considering their real needs. Ergonomics, which existed at Bauhaus, is an example of this thinking.</p>
<p>(See also this <a title="Episodes of collective inventions" href="http://www.bls.gov/ore/pdf/ec030050.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>, that shows episodes of collective inventions since tre 1850s).</p>
<p>Still regarding the notion of participatory design: in a country which is ´in development´ such as Brazil, the notion of designing in an empirical way is quite culturally pervasive: due to the fact that people don´t have everything readily at hand, people are necessarily required to establish a relationship with the <em>means</em> (the means as the environment and the means of accomplishing their designs), without the burden of an environmental rigidity (in terms of what is considered a ´best practice´), since everything is still under construction and deconstruction. In this regard, there are scholars who study the ´gambiarra´ (a sort of ´ugly hack´) as a contemporary utilitarian improvisation in its socioeconomic context. Vilém Flusser also discusses about designing in an empirical way in his book &#8220;Philosophy of Design&#8221;, using as example the first lever invented.</p>
<p>What it has to do with my proposal: during my studies, design methodologies that were presented to me were very linear, and in a way that should give as much control as possible to the project manager: 1- outlining the problem; 2- accumulation of data; 3- incubation + ideation; 4- production and verification, or, altertatively: analytical phase, creative phase and implementation phase. In practice, I realized that those methodologies were like a utopia: the actual design process was never straight and clean in that way proscribed – even considering the iterations anticipated in these methods – , nor did the manager ever have such a degree of control over the process.</p>
<p>Indeed, the more control, the less openness to the unexpected, to the <strong>emergence of languages</strong>, that can occur at various levels: the emergence of a new behavior, of a novel cultural expression (since my main references are projects that involve citizens in their spaces); the emergence of a visual, audiovisual and / or interactive pattern (standard?); the incorporation of the unpredictable to the system itself; or the redesign of a sequence of actions in the project development, in order to adapt to new inputs (user interaction, incorporation of content from users, who thereby become co-creators), among others.</p>
<p>(these emergent behaviors, patterns, events &#8211; in one word: languages &#8211; , might also come from some kind of machine learning. I´m still working on this topic, but it won´t be the focus here).</p>
<p>Actually, processes of creation don´t begin from a well-defined problem: the design problem is constantly redefined in the process, with the entry of new information. Contemporary objects present themselves as complex objects (in the sense that remain open to other functions, to other appropriations by users, uses unforeseen in the initial project).</p>
<p>This is in contrast with an environment that avoids the noise and closes its doors to the unexpected, before AND after the ´product´ is launched (the term ´product´ is understood here as a process in constant evolution, not as an end point).</p>
<p>Focusing on the theme of the proposal: with the growth of collaborative projects, the unexpected has increasingly begun to be understood not as a failure (or noise) of the process, but as something that should be embraced as an opportunity to expand the product´s possibilities. Design solutions became provisional, not final. This approach has an <strong>element of opening</strong> and it is precisely the nature of this openness that I want to investigate.</p>
<p>From my humble view &#8211; as someone who works in design within the market context, and as a teacher &#8211; the design process is a living organism, akin to living systems. As a teacher, every time I was required to suggest readings about design methodologies for students, I always had to indicate these traditional concepts, seemingly perfect, as if design processes were in fact developed that way. In fact, I don´t think this is how they work.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">ROZENFELD, H.; et al., 2006.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.ideo.com/" target="_blank">IDEO</a>, for example, design involves three fields of activities: inspiration, ideation and implementation (BROWN, 2010). I have the impression that this process still appears as a sequence and not as a living organism. Of course I need to study more, to be able to say.</p>
<p>The process outlined below may serve a clue, the role of the designer in this figure may be replaced by regular users, or communities, or even combined with some kind of artificial intelligence:</p>
<p><a href="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/onformative.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-406 size-full aligncenter" src="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/onformative.jpg" alt="onformative" width="425" height="265" srcset="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/onformative.jpg 425w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/onformative-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Generative Design – <a title="Onformative on Campus Party" href="https://vimeo.com/48858267" target="_blank">Onformative Studio</a></p>
<p>Here at the Media Lab, the apparent absence of a super pre-defined work methodology for all projects (or even: the variety of existing methods) suggests a huge opening.</p>
<p>So, I want to investigate this opening element as a means of revising the traditional design concepts nowadays. The field of practice is already aware about these issues, perhaps theories are slow to catch up. Of course there are authors with different conceptions of <strong>creation</strong> (mainly in the arts) as a much more flexible process. I hope to meet more authors with this line of thinking, especially in the field of Design (focused on interactive artifacts).</p>
<p>I wonder: what is the design of this process (a live process) like? What are its dynamics? And I recognize that when one tries to grasp it, one loses its pulse. Any explicit representation would destroy its pulse wave. Any truly useful interpretation could not be fit into a defined structure.</p>
<p>However, I´m not interested in philosophizing if it´s not practical. Philosophy is practical. The world demands action. This is why I became involved with the <a title="ZL Vórtice Project blog" href="https://zlvortice.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">ZL Vortex</a> project. Design serves to that: to contribute to the technological and cultural development and well-being of humanity within its environment.</p>
<p>Translations from the project blog can be found <a title="Translations from the blog" href="https://pt.scribd.com/doc/258863317/ZL-Vortice-ZL-Vortice-Project%20" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Starting from the definition of the ZL Vórtice project problem (although it will be redefined &#8220;N&#8221; times during the project), the next step is to conduct a study of similar projects, along with the collection of information for the project. <a href="http://mapkibera.org/" target="_blank">Map Kibera</a>, <a href="http://www.ngo20.org/?lang=en" target="_blank">NGO 2.0</a> and <a href="http://promisetracker.org/" target="_blank">Promise Tracker</a> are good reference projects for ZL Vórtice. Below, in brief, is how I plan to conduct the studies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seemingly contradictory characteristics of a project used as a reference will be problematized in a complex view: the elements / components that favor the openness of the system will be described, as well as elements that do not, such as their adaptability and self-organization, or even possible constraints, not necessarily related to technology;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Technologies used for the development of the project will be investigated. This investigation will explore questions like: to what extent can the project be considered as a reprogrammable system, in co-evolution with other involved systems, such as social, cultural and aesthetic systems;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I will investigate whether the productions (projects used as references), as systems, respond to user interactions in an inventive way.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would really appreciate suggestions of readings from colleagues, especially when it comes to the approach I outline here, focused on this opening of the system, considering design methodology as a living system.</p>

			<p><strong>First example:</strong></p>
<p><a title="stringwire" href="https://www.stringwire.com/latest" target="_blank">Stringwire.com</a> is a platform of videos created by users with a smartphone, and made avaliable to the public in real time. NBC News bought this platform to gain a foothold in the digital news space. It also allows people to share videos in their social networks. Although it is valuable when it comes to citizen participation in the construction of content, there are some flaws in its design, regarding to:</p>
<p>&#8211; Promoting a network between users. I couldn´t even find other user´s profiles;</p>
<p>&#8211; Seeing relations between locations. If you want to see the map in a wider window, it doesn’t allow you to open it in a new tab for example, and each map shows only the location of that specific video (it doesn´t show several locations in the same map).</p>
<p>&#8211; Searching themes. I couldn´t find the search engine (a field for putting key words in order to search a video of my interest);</p>
<p>&#8211; Organizing videos within a context. Apparently, there is no organization/classification of the videos, they´re only presented in a chronological order. Probably because the project is in its beta version.</p>
<p><a href="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Untitled-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-392 size-full" src="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Untitled-2.jpg" alt="stringwire" width="1169" height="663" srcset="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Untitled-2.jpg 1169w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Untitled-2-300x170.jpg 300w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Untitled-2-1024x581.jpg 1024w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Untitled-2-500x284.jpg 500w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Untitled-2-900x510.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1169px) 100vw, 1169px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second example:</strong></p>
<p>The following tool  &#8211; <a href="http://wikimapps.com/">http://wikimapps.com/</a> &#8211; uses Google Maps to collaboratively map informations, such as:</p>
<p>&#8211; Making reports and exposing community problems;</p>
<p>&#8211; Providing social and humanitarian aid;</p>
<p>&#8211; Mapping culture and leisure, among others.</p>
<p>Regarding to connecting users, it is much better than the first example. The following image shows a network of friends you can engage in a map (this example shows a mapping of startups):</p>
<p><a href="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/wikimapps.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-393 size-full" src="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/wikimapps.jpg" alt="wikimapps" width="1366" height="666" srcset="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/wikimapps.jpg 1366w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/wikimapps-300x146.jpg 300w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/wikimapps-1024x499.jpg 1024w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/wikimapps-500x244.jpg 500w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/wikimapps-900x439.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></a></p>
<p>Regular users can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a record on the map (through points, lines and/or polygons);</li>
<li>See the data of a record;</li>
<li>Search records on the map;</li>
<li>Search for addresses on the map;</li>
<li>Filter records on the map;</li>
<li>Comment on a record;</li>
<li>Receive notifications;</li>
<li>See record intensity spots (hot spots);</li>
<li>Identify which are the most seen, commented and evaluated records.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Wikimapps project fails in the bad graphic user interface and excess of advertisements.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t make any automatic relations between data and data visualization, such as <a href="http://dataviva.info/">http://dataviva.info/</a> does (a tool developed partially by the Macro Connections group from Media Lab).</p>
<p>Even though its complexity, Data Viva offers a great and intuitive user interface (the only reason it doesn’t fit in this assignment is that this project doesn’t seem to be crowd sourced (yet it is collaborative in its development between institutions).</p>

<p>“<a title="State and Space" href="http://occupydatanyc.org/2012/03/24/state-and-space/" target="_blank">State and Space</a>” is an project created by the team at <a title="Occupy Data NYC .org" href="http://OccupyDataNYC.org" target="_blank">OccupyDataNYC.org</a> that attempts to surface and address police abuse, particularly surrounding the Occupy movement. Quoting an early description by the team, State and Space attempts to “examine the frequency and nature of incidents related to interactions between the NYPD and the Occupy movement, including the use of tactics intended to harm peaceful protesters, identity-based discrimination, other abuses of power and benevolence.” [1]
<p>30,000+ tweets were initially used to create the application, analysis, and visualization that are the outputs of the project. This hints at some of the architecture that this project leverages to enable a semi-collaborative outcome that holds police accountable for misconduct. By relying on Twitter, a platform heavily used by the Occupy movement, the project gains an existing platform for the publication and data collection of an already active digital public sphere. By using text analysis and word occurrence counting, they find patterns in the already existing outcries and reports documenting misconduct. It leverages the IBM visualization platform ManyEyes to display the data in a visually compelling way. While State and Space is clearly well-intentioned, and here are a series of questions around the inclusiveness and effectiveness</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Inclusive Is It?</strong></p>
<p>Twitter is the required form of submission for this system. It admittedly is a bit of a stretch to call this project collaborative (see “Interactive” below) however the project is made up of the contributions of many people, all aiming to reveal the same types of abuse. It is important to consider who has this agency. Certainly there are many people without access or knowledge of how to interact with Twitter, or even the understanding that using this platform to report abuse might result in any kind of response or impact. In addition, this is a closed system. One is required to sign up for an account with a specific entity. The potential for minority groups or disenfranchised populations to be targeted by police, especially in the city, is unfortunately high. It is important to consider who can collaborate and participate when one designs a system that should represent anyone and everyone in society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Interactive is it?</strong></p>
<p>Many tools in the space of government innovation and intervention are non-interactive. (For examples, refer to <a title="Sunlight Foundation Tools" href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/tools/#filtered" target="_blank">almost every Sunlight Foundation project</a>.) They grease the rails and reduce barriers to existing data stores, sometimes in extremely innovative ways. These projects are extremely valuable, but the focus is on access, and not contribution or collaboration. In State and Space, the data was initially scraped from a platform at a point in time (presumably with the plan to continue scraping at intervals) but this has a limited interactivity. Setting aside for the moment concerns about the abuse of contribution to a system like this once known, where controls and metrics for preventing and flagging are absent, the ability to contribute to and collaborate with this system is truncated. It is understandable that the project was build with limited resources and time, but this calls out requirements for extra-government solutions that need to be accounted for. If the system design is such that users can only contribute from the outside, and have no agency once the data is ingested from another platform, users are effectively cut off from a continuing dialog around the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Sustainable and Persistent Is It?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-11-at-01.54.22.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-382" src="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-11-at-01.54.22-300x138.png" alt="State and Space Visualization" width="300" height="138" srcset="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-11-at-01.54.22-300x138.png 300w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-11-at-01.54.22-1024x470.png 1024w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-11-at-01.54.22-500x230.png 500w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-11-at-01.54.22-900x413.png 900w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-11-at-01.54.22.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Platforms come and go. Applications built on these platforms go with them. One of the first things you notice upon visiting State and Space is that it’s missing. The interactive visualizations were hosted on IBM’s service and as far as one can tell, they are lost to code or platform rot. This raises some significant questions about what is required of technology that is deployed to patch holes in government. While they may take a very long time to build, and are the brunt of many jokes, the degree to which governmental systems are designed and tested for scale and hosted on platforms that are build for longevity is significant. Far from an argument against these kinds of innovations, experiments, and interventions, this is simply a reality check for many platforms that aim to be a real and lasting fix to governmental ills. If the goal is for a platform to make it beyond the weekend hackathon or the spare time afforded by the developer, serious thought and effort needs to be put into who will keep it running and how, and what provisions are made for archiving or persisting the discourse or content that takes place on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Note on Benevolence:</strong></p>
<p>As it appears, the inclusion of “benevolence” in the list of goals for this project seems like an afterthought. It may well have been, but it is an important inclusion nonetheless. Building collaborative technologies requires thought about who the audience and intended user base is. Who is going to be collaborating? One can imagine ways in which the police themselves might participate in this conversation and contribute valuable perspectives. If they are cut out of this opportunity, or if they are made to feel that the collaborative space is one that is inherently against them, some of the potential for efficacy and positive benefit is lost. This may be more of a philosophical question when dealing with abuse of power and authority in government, but the thought the designers had that they might highlight actions that deserve merit is a powerful conceptual addition to the model.</p>

			<p>One of the oldest services that governments have provided their citizens is the construction and maintenance of roads. To make life better for those who use roads, some of the most modern governments have begun using state of the art technology to notify drivers of their status, enabling them to plan around things like construction or traffic-causing accidents. One such high-tech solution can be seen below:</p>

<p>AM radio, a state of the art technology invented in 1900, is used by departments of transportation in many forward-thinking states to help drivers navigate treacherous traffic conditions. We can all think of multiple times in our lives where those helpful flashing lights have encouraged us to tune in on our AM radios for some time-saving advice. Another state of the art solution provided more commonly by governments is shown here:</p>
<div id="attachment_373" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/road-sign.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-373" class="wp-image-373" src="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/road-sign.jpg" alt="Source: http://s3.freefoto.com/images/41/15/41_15_13_web.jpg" width="500" height="335" srcset="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/road-sign.jpg 600w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/road-sign-300x201.jpg 300w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/road-sign-448x300.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-373" class="wp-caption-text">Source: http://s3.freefoto.com/images/41/15/41_15_13_web.jpg</p></div>
<p>Ok, you get the point. Government solutions to non-critical problems with their services (and even some critical ones) tend to be outdated, unreliable and generally unhelpful. They hardly solve the problem at all.</p>
<p>Waze is a Tel-Aviv based startup that was founded in 2008 with the goal of reliably providing traffic and road condition information in the absence of successful government solutions. They succeeded. Waze built a GPS navigation app which allows users to submit reports of everything from accidents to construction to police speed traps. They even partnered with Google and FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Sandy to allow reporting of gas stations that had fuel. Acquired by Google in June 2013 for $966M, Waze has over 36 million users who have shared over 90 million reports in over 110 countries [1].</p>
<div id="attachment_374" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/waze.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-374" class="wp-image-374" src="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/waze.png" alt="Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Waze_3.5_Screen.png#mediaviewer/File:Waze_3.5_Screen.png" width="250" height="375" srcset="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/waze.png 640w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/waze-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-374" class="wp-caption-text">Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Waze_3.5_Screen.png#mediaviewer/File:Waze_3.5_Screen.png</p></div>
<p>When we evaluate Waze critically, we find that it is highly generative, data-centric and slightly encouraging of openness. It is highly generative because Waze’s users produce most of the valuable content on the platform with Waze simply enabling them to do so. The more users on the Waze platform, the more valuable it becomes for everyone else. It is data-centric because the data on Waze’s platform is their primary asset and the primary value-add for users. Waze is slightly encouraging of openness because it distributes information that used to be locked up in the minds of construction workers, emergency responders or individuals stuck in traffic to a larger group of people.</p>
<p>Yet one of the critical places where Waze scores extremely poorly is in the domain of preserving privacy and individual liberties. Waze’s demise in this category, like many modern internet companies, stems from their privacy policy regarding the information they collect on you. Before we go into that, we must begin with what specific information Waze collects:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Detailed location and route information to create a detailed location history of all of the journeys you have made while using the Application”</li>
<li>“All of the phone numbers which are stored on your device’s phone book” (if you opt into the ‘find friends feature’)</li>
<li>Search queries within the Waze app [2]</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course it is in Waze’s best interest to collect all of this information. They can use it to improve their own services, get a better understanding of their users and support their company financially through directed advertising. None of this is particularly onerous or damaging to individual liberties (at least in my opinion). Developing a better service is in all stakeholders best interest and a private company needs a strong business model to sustain the services it provides.</p>
<p>Where Waze strays away from protecting civil liberties is when it comes to how they are allowed use your data. One particularly onerous sections of their privacy policy and its implications are outlined below:</p>
<p>Waze will share your personal information with others without your consent “to comply with any applicable law and assist law enforcement agencies under any applicable law, when Waze has a good faith belief that Waze’s cooperation with the law enforcement agencies is legally mandated or meets the applicable legal standards and procedures,” [2]
<p>Remember, if you are an active Waze user then Waze has a personal history of most places you’ve driven, places you are thinking about going and your live location if you have the app open. Operating on the assumption that governments always apply laws justly, this is not a problem. Unfortunately history has shown us that this assumption is frequently incorrect. And in that case, Waze provides these governments with a(nother) tool to track the exact whereabouts of Waze users of interest. As a digital trends article on the subject put it, “Anything you share with Waze can be used against you in a court of law,” [3].</p>
<p>Waze has also started negotiating deals with governments of places like Rio De Jeneiro and Florida to share data bi-directionally with departments of transportation [4]. While this is great for improving the services of both parties, it is a bad sign for user privacy that Waze is using private user data as a bargaining chip for better access to data from governments.</p>
<p>Since Waze scores so poorly in the privacy category, it begs the question: can such a platform exist that does better? Could a platform modeled after Benkler’s nonmarket peer-production concepts provide as effective of a service without compromising on privacy? While this is clearly an open question that deserves a deeper analysis, I believe that it can and it is a service that I would love to see in the world. Until then, it appears that as a privacy-concerned person I’m stuck tuning into my AM radio for my traffic information.</p>

			<p>First of all, I would like to remember some key points in Benkler’s work. He understands that the collaboration between individuals in the common space (or networked public sphere, in some assumptions) can result in public goods. This is a generous idea, but it is also real and economic-based, as he demonstrated rigorously in his book. The Benkler’s perspective recognizes that human beings generally act motived by capital or material gains, but at same time he believes that human beings act by psychological and sociological gratification.</p>
<p>Benkler identifies some criticisms addressed to collaboration in online platforms, but he argues that the Internet is revolutionary compared to mass media. There is some limitations in the internet landscape, but this media is the most open ever. Anyone can engage in complex and huge projects, with small or big contributions according to skills and motivation, which can result in meaningful goods to everyone.</p>
<p>Remembering the collaboration conception in this terms is important, because this approach is more demanding than collaboration in private workplace. In this view, collaboration is more than to do something with someone, it is do something with someone else oriented to common interest.</p>
<div id="attachment_375" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Changeset-7931-Colab-Comunidades-Interlegis.clipular-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-375" class="wp-image-375 size-large" src="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Changeset-7931-Colab-Comunidades-Interlegis.clipular-2-1024x490.png" alt="Changeset 7931 - Colab - Comunidades Interlegis.clipular (2)" width="584" height="279" srcset="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Changeset-7931-Colab-Comunidades-Interlegis.clipular-2-1024x490.png 1024w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Changeset-7931-Colab-Comunidades-Interlegis.clipular-2-300x144.png 300w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Changeset-7931-Colab-Comunidades-Interlegis.clipular-2-500x239.png 500w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Changeset-7931-Colab-Comunidades-Interlegis.clipular-2-900x431.png 900w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Changeset-7931-Colab-Comunidades-Interlegis.clipular-2.png 1894w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-375" class="wp-caption-text">Colab &#8211; https://colab.interlegis.leg.br/ci/</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we quote some important topics of the Benkler’s view, I would like to report two cases of collaboration which are trying to address challenges inside the public sector. First, <a href="https://colab.interlegis.leg.br/ci/">Colab</a> is a platform to Brazilian public servants discuss common problems and exchange codes. The platform is open and everyone may participate. Using this platform to exchange solutions, the governmental team spends less time and money, as strongly recommended by Tim O’Reilly.</p>
<p>But the collaboration inside the government is not just a good strategy because it save resources, but also because diversity of skills and perspective improve the quality of the web pages and others applications. Notwithstanding the platform be used by Brazilian coders, Colab is open to everyone everywhere. Who wants to create something like the Brazilian projects may uses the codes for free.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to talk about <a href="http://poplus.org/about/faq/">Poplus</a>, a platform founded by <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">MySociety</a> and <a href="http://ciudadanointeligente.org/">CiudadanoInteligente.org</a>, define themselves as “an international community of activists, citizens and developers” that intend to create “standardized, internationalized, interoperable, open-source components, to make it easier to build websites that empower citizens, no matter where you are based”.</p>
<div id="attachment_377" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Poplus.clipular.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-377" class="wp-image-377 size-large" src="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Poplus.clipular-1024x504.jpg" alt="Poplus.clipular" width="584" height="287" srcset="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Poplus.clipular-1024x504.jpg 1024w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Poplus.clipular-300x148.jpg 300w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Poplus.clipular-500x246.jpg 500w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Poplus.clipular-900x443.jpg 900w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Poplus.clipular.jpg 1894w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-377" class="wp-caption-text">Poplus &#8211; http://poplus.org/</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple and helpful idea is to offer codes of applications that can be used by governs to engage citizens. Once civic media has frequently the same functions, they created at least five modules which may be adapted to specific needs (see here). So everyone may reuse codes written by someone else, thus resources have been saved. The access to code is open and everyone may join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus">Poplus Google Group</a> to ask informations and report its experience.</p>
<p>To conclude this post, I want to remember some O’Reilly tips: open standards and open development of solutions have an extraordinary power to engage citizens in searching solutions to public problems. People worldwide can work together collaboratively to help to strengthen the relation between governments and citizens.</p>

			<p>What&#8217;s the safest speed to travel on a freeway? If you guessed the speed limit, you&#8217;re probably wrong! There is pretty strong evidence to suggest that the safest speed to travel is the speed the other cars are traveling. ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/06/texas_85_mile_per_hour_speed_limit_do_higher_speed_limits_cause_more_accidents_.html )</p>
<p>However, the cheapest speed to travel is definitely at or below the speed limit, because of aggressive police speed ticketing. For instance, Hampton, Florida (and a couple other small towns) had formed a notoriously corrupt police force where there was a department so large there was a police officer for every 25 residents. This police force performed one task, ticketing people speeding on the highway passing through, neglecting to keep drugs out of the community or perform other tasks. (http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/09/us/hampton-florida-corruption/).  Although the town faced many other oddities and corruptions that make it a less than stellar example, traffic &amp; parking tickets have a bad reputation of existing solely to fund police departments, especially when civil asset seizure is also considered (http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/10/11/cash-seizures-fuel-police-spending/) (http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/02/kaley_v_united_states_terrible_supreme_court_decision_lets_the_government.html).</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.waze.com/" target="_blank">Waze,</a> collaborative community based traffic mapping system which addresses the lack of oversight of police. Waze allows users to let other users know where police are monitoring, so that drivers can be alert and not get caught &#8216;driving unsafely&#8217;. Not so subtly, the following image appears on Waze&#8217;s website:</p>
<p><a href="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-10-at-10.44.37-PM.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-357 aligncenter" src="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-10-at-10.44.37-PM-300x216.png" alt="waze" width="300" height="216" srcset="http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-10-at-10.44.37-PM-300x216.png 300w, http://civic-media-class.wordpress.brownbag.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-10-at-10.44.37-PM.png 409w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally, this isn&#8217;t too popular with police. It&#8217;s curious to see what arguments &amp; strategies are used:</p>
<p>LAPD Police Chief argued that Waze endangers officers by letting would-be criminals track their locations. http://www.cnbc.com/id/102373083# . However, many critique law enforcement for defending an important source of revenue https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150126/08232429821/law-enforcement-wants-google-to-cripple-waze-because-it-lets-mean-old-public-stalk-police-officers.shtml. At Waze, however, the argument tends that knowing a police officer is around increases road safety as people are more likely to drive safely http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/08/opinion/navarrette-waze-speed-traps/ .</p>
<p>With this context, let&#8217;s discuss how Waze is and isn&#8217;t a networked public sphere.</p>
<p>Firstly, Waze is a community which does produce a shared common good. This is commons based production, but due to the central authority over the information, I think it fails to fully meet Benkler&#8217;s peer standard. However, much of the economics of peer production still applies. There are not only different types of users who will either use, not use, or use &amp; add to the data but also car pooling groups, which may use Waze differently (perhaps shotgun resumes its role in defending from bandits).</p>
<p>This is a network which greatly helps individual liberty by helping users to avoid police interference. Although in its nascence, technology like Waze can be deployed to monitor police in other situations. For instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukey">Sukey</a> was used and built to help UCL protestors avoid police kettling (a controversial crowd control tactic). In this case, the technology fits more into Benkler&#8217;s views on internet communities &#8212; Sukey facilitates a meatspace interaction, but leans heavily on the virtual space to ensure the freedoms of such groups.</p>
<p>In the Waze network, data is of utmost import. The data created, however, is centralized on Google servers. This means that it will serve google purposes, ie, knowing that people slow down near police markers Waze may choose to show police markers near google billboards, or play other tricks, such as inaccurately reporting police presence at the request of a local department.</p>
<p>Overall, I don&#8217;t think that Waze is an idealized Networked Public Sphere, but I do think that it serves an important role: it get&#8217;s people collaborating to solve a problem, and using internet technology to perform the collaboration. If Sukey is any guide it is that when specific, more serious, issues arise turning to a collaborative model will be natural, and we have the design techniques &amp; software to be able to roll such a system out quickly and in an ad-hoc manner.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>For this week&#8217;s assignment, I thought it would be best to look at some of the initiatives taken by various government websites to employ Benkler&#8217;s Gov 2.0. I came across a website that I had heard of before but never actually took the time to look at- <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.ny.gov/</span>. At first glance, <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.ny.gov/</span> looked like exactly what Benkler called for.</p>
<p>When you first enter the site, you see various issues and are allowed to show your support for them. Under the issue, there is a tab called &#8220;Get Involved&#8221; that surprisingly lets you get involved. Similar to petitions, this form asks you to sign in and then show your support for the program so that your electronic signature can be accounted for. Unlike other petition websites that I have seen, you can also provide your own story regarding the issue. You can state how the issue impacted you and state your own opinion regarding the issue rather than just being cast into a simple for or against position. The site also offers data and statistics to back up the stance of the petition. Even though this data does not really allow the government to get a better idea of the needs of the citizens, this seemed to be exactly what Benkler wanted. People would be participating directly within government by offering their opinions on major issues.</p>
<p>This site even went past the simple petitioning site. It offered methods to complete certain tasks that involved the government such as filling out tax returns or starting your own business. It also had a section that tells users about events in New York State where the issues brought up on the website would be discussed. When you add the use of apps by <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.ny.gov/</span> to further inform the public about everyday issues such as crime and transportation, <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.ny.gov/</span> appears to be Gov 2.0 in action. The main problem I found with this website was what Benkler first proposed for the new Gov 2.0-openness.</p>
<p>Benkler repeatedly mentioned that these Gov 2.0 sites should be open to spark growth and innovation. Users would be able to input their ideas and the government could learn from the citizens. The site <span style="text-decoration: underline">http://www.ny.gov/</span> does not allow this to happen. From what I saw, all the issues that were brought up and discussed were brought up by the makers of the website. The users of the site could not propose to discuss about a issue that was troubling them. All the issues that were discussed were the issues the government wanted for the citizens of New York State to discuss. Albeit these issues are relevant and significant, it seems to go directly against Benkler&#8217;s ideal Gov 2.0. Benkler wanted for the citizens and the government to work with one another in an open, unrestricted space so that effective change would come about. The website looks like it is only willing to do this for issues it feels are appropriate for this new type of discussion. This made me wonder just how ready is the government for Gov 2.0? Gov 2.0 would take away some of the power of the government and place it in the hands of the citizens. But aren&#8217;t we in a democracy so all the power already lies in the hand of the people? Or are we in an oligarchy and Gov 2.0 would represent a revolution towards a true democracy?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was curious to research what Sao Paulo, the city I used to live in, has been doing over the last months for improving its relation with the citizens through the Internet. Perhaps the first thing that caught my attention was the lack of uniformity: there are sites with a brutal technological gap and unusual solutions and others with bold and interesting fresh new ideas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the first one crossed my way initially. <a href="http://www3.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/zelando_cidade/FormsPublic/HomeZelando.aspx">Taking care of the City</a> is a section of Sao Paulo City&#8217;s website, the largest metropolis in South America, that, according to the government, &#8220;was created to help the citizen fiscalize the public services&#8221;. The idea, in theory, goes along with the basics of web 2.0 and government 2.0 defined by Tim O&#8217;Reilly, stimulating people&#8217;s participation, the collective inteligence, to create a database that, by themselves, public employees would take years to develop &#8211; or an eternity.</p>
<p>That, of course, sounds good in theory. Taking as an example street cleaning, one of the easiest public tasks to take care of, as it requires some patience and a comfortable spot by the window of your house. The city site informs the weekday and period when the cleaning of a street should be done. If anything goes wrong, according to the page, it is possible to complain&#8230; making a telephone to call a service central. If the person is using a computer or mobile to access the information, the rational outcome would be to allow he/she to continue the process on the same media. Certainly this one walks away from the &#8220;design for participation&#8221; concept. As a citizen that has used the aforementioned phone service more than once, I can say it usually takes 10 to 15 minutes to complete a complaint.</p>
<p>On the bright side, however, there is a very good example of participative lawmaking that was developed during the final stages of debating the new zoning plan for the city. A version of the project that would be sent to the City Council was <a href="http://minuta.gestaourbana.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/">put on the internet on the same shape as a Github project,</a> open for participation on every coding line &#8211; in this case, represented by every article of the proposal. On the left of the screen, a window allowed the user to compare the project with the existing law, approved in 2004. Again, it finds echo in what O&#8217;Reilly visioned as government 2.0: clear rules for cooperation (you can comment on each paragraph and agree or not with the proposal, giving an overview of the region, for instance) with some supervising from the city technical staff.</p>
<p>However, this idea attracted only 1,500 comments, a very small number considering the city has 11,000,000 people that will be affected by the new law. And perhaps this aspect can be considered a symptom of failure in achieving the &#8220;true citizen participation&#8221;, that, according to O&#8217;Reilly, does not rely only in technicians getting inputs from citizens.</p>
