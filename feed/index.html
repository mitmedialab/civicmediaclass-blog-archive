					<description><![CDATA[There’s a problem brewing in America: the American way of life is facing an attack which could shred the fundamental liberties and rights enjoyed by its citizens to pieces. This attack is multifaceted, and comes not in the form of boots on the ground, but a misalignment on the fundamental tenets of what is required for free and open society. Civic participation is down. Mistrust in the institutions which define our society is up, and &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/13/the-combine-2/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Concerns over two particular problems with American society have grown over the recent years. The first and perhaps more broadly evident is the volatility of the economy. The Great Recession and the feeble job market that accompanied it shook the faith that many held in the nation’s markets and financial institutions. An ever-widening wealth gap has not helped to reinstate any of the confidence that was lost, and a government that has proved at many times &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/13/mint-it-yourself-making-complementary-currencies-more-compelling/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Abstract: Habermas&#8217; public sphere is a critical architectural component of democracies around the world. In this paper, I argue that while the public sphere is important, the psychology literature dictates that the public sphere could never have existed as the ideal discursive space ruled by reason that Habermas described. I then argue that the phenomenon of denialism, where large amounts of people reject the scientific consensus on an issue, is the result of an exploitation &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/13/the-thanksgiving-playbook-a-tool-to-combat-denialism-and-help-you-win-thanksgiving-debates/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I propose a platform for civic data analysis based on the MIT CSAIL project DataHub. DataHub is a GitHub for data, allowing users to follow other users and their data analysis projects and fork others’ projects to extend them. It provides an ecosystem of composable applications for data ingestion, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. I argue that DataHub’s centralization of datasets and analyses on a single platform, support for extension of others’ analyses, and emphasis &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/13/civic-data-analysis-with-datahub/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The networked public sphere is today’s most active domain of public debate. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and a number of micro-spheres in the form of comment sections on news sites and blogs provide a platform unlike open societies have ever seen. Debate rages on the internet, thanks to significantly open exposure of ideas, and at least the potential of finding ideas far divergent from one’s own. There were hopes early on in the days of &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/13/pairwise-empathy-socio-structural-interventions-for-the-networked-public-sphere/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

Whether it was race or language, these man made classifications have mainly been used to further separate humanity. One aspect of human culture that has managed to transcend this is music. Music is one of the most diverse fields yet musicians are still able to come together and understand one other thanks to hearing each other play.

The harms of legal ignorance are explored, and issues of equality in the status quo are raised. The benefits of general legal knowledge for society are also explored and used to motivate the proposal. A legal ontology tailored to this project is established.

					<description><![CDATA[Abstract Chat rooms can be highly toxic. They are the frequent haunt of trolls and spammers. This is especially true for chat rooms connected to live video streams. But chat rooms are also one of the only places where viewers can discuss what they are seeing in real time with a group of people who are all seeing the same thing. Communities form around chat rooms, and they sometimes develop their own unique culture and &#8230; <a href="https://civicmediaclass.mit.edu/2015/05/12/building-a-better-chat-room/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
